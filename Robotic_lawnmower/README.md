## Git Example Workflow Usage from the CLI

1. use command: git clone https://<username>@bitbucket.org/jstahnke/6310_team05.git
2. make changes to source code files with VIM, gedit, netbeans, intellij, etc.
3. before commit, ensure you are on the latest commit using command "git pull"
4. resolve any merge conflicts ("git stash" is useful for minimizing the pain of merge conflicts)
5. use command: git add <filename1> [<filename2> ...] to stage your modified or new files
